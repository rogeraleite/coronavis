The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents\u00a0to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101","C7_Restrictions_on_internal_movement":2.0,"C8_International_travel_controls":3.0,"C8_Notes":null,"E1_Flag":null,"E1_Income_support":0.0,"E1_Notes":null,"E2_Debt_or_contract_relief":0.0,"E2_Notes":null,"E3_Fiscal_measures":0.0,"E3_Notes":null,"E4_International_support":0.0,"E4_Notes":null,"H1_Flag":1.0,"H1_Notes":null,"H1_Public_information_campaigns":2.0,"H2_Notes":null,"H2_Testing_policy":3.0,"H3_Contact_tracing":1.0,"H3_Notes":null,"H4_Emergency_investment_in_healthcare":0.0,"H4_Notes":null,"H5_Investment_in_vaccines":0.0,"H5_Notes":null,"LegacyStringencyIndex":68.1,"LegacyStringencyIndexForDisplay":68.1,"M1_Notes":null,"M1_Wildcard":null,"StringencyIndex":64.44,"StringencyIndexForDisplay":64.44,"country":"US","date":1584576000000},{"C1_Flag":0.0,"C1_Notes":null,"C1_School_closing":3.0,"C2_Flag":0.0,"C2_Notes":null,"C2_Workplace_closing":3.0,"C3_Cancel_public_events":2.0,"C3_Flag":0.0,"C3_Notes":null,"C4_Flag":0.0,"C4_Notes":null,"C4_Restrictions_on_gatherings":2.0,"C5_Close_public_transport":1.0,"C5_Flag":0.0,"C5_Notes":null,"C6_Flag":0.0,"C6_Notes":null,"C6_Stay_at_home_requirements":2.0,"C7_Flag":0.0,"C7_Notes":null,"C7_Restrictions_on_internal_movement":2.0,"C8_International_travel_controls":3.0,"C8_Notes":null,"E1_Flag":null,"E1_Income_support":0.0,"E1_Notes":null,"E2_Debt_or_contract_relief":0.0,"E2_Notes":null,"E3_Fiscal_measures":0.0,"E3_Notes":null,"E4_International_support":0.0,"E4_Notes":null,"H1_Flag":1.0,"H1_Notes":null,"H1_Public_information_campaigns":2.0,"H2_Notes":null,"H2_Testing_policy":3.0,"H3_Contact_tracing":1.0,"H3_Notes":null,"H4_Emergency_investment_in_healthcare":0.0,"H4_Notes":null,"H5_Investment_in_vaccines":0.0,"H5_Notes":null,"LegacyStringencyIndex":68.1,"LegacyStringencyIndexForDisplay":68.1,"M1_Notes":null,"M1_Wildcard":null,"StringencyIndex":64.44,"StringencyIndexForDisplay":64.44,"country":"US","date":1584662400000},{"C1_Flag":0.0,"C1_Notes":null,"C1_School_closing":3.0,"C2_Flag":0.0,"C2_Notes":null,"C2_Workplace_closing":3.0,"C3_Cancel_public_events":2.0,"C3_Flag":0.0,"C3_Notes":null,"C4_Flag":0.0,"C4_Notes":"State by state differences shown in archived link: https:\/\/archive.vn\/6NqU4  Illinois March 21 at 5 p.m., which bans gatherings of more than 10 people.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock  \u201cWe are currently testing the new NHS contact tracing app. If you become unwell with symptoms of coronavirus, you\u2019ll be able to tell the NHS via this app. The app will then send an alert to other app users that you\u2019ve been in significant contact with in recent days, even before you had the symptoms. So that they know and they can act accordingly, so we can get tests to people even if they are asymptomatic.\u201d","H4_Emergency_investment_in_healthcare":0.0,"H4_Notes":null,"H5_Investment_in_vaccines":0.0,"H5_Notes":null,"LegacyStringencyIndex":77.38,"LegacyStringencyIndexForDisplay":77.38,"M1_Notes":null,"M1_Wildcard":null,"StringencyIndex":79.63,"StringencyIndexForDisplay":79.63,"country":"United
