The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents\u00a0to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101","C7_Restrictions_on_internal_movement":2.0,"C8_International_travel_controls":3.0,"C8_Notes":null,"ContainmentHealthIndex":68.56,"ContainmentHealthIndexForDisplay":68.56,"E1_Flag":null,"E1_Income_support":0.0,"E1_Notes":null,"E2_Debt_or_contract_relief":0.0,"E2_Notes":null,"E3_Fiscal_measures":0.0,"E3_Notes":null,"E4_International_support":0.0,"E4_Notes":null,"EconomicSupportIndex":0.0,"EconomicSupportIndexForDisplay":0.0,"GovernmentResponseIndex":58.01,"GovernmentResponseIndexForDisplay":58.01,"H1_Flag":1.0,"H1_Notes":null,"H1_Public_information_campaigns":2.0,"H2_Notes":null,"H2_Testing_policy":3.0,"H3_Contact_tracing":1.0,"H3_Notes":null,"H4_Emergency_investment_in_healthcare":0.0,"H4_Notes":null,"H5_Investment_in_vaccines":0.0,"H5_Notes":null,"M1_Notes":null,"M1_Wildcard":null,"StringencyIndex":67.13,"StringencyIndexForDisplay":67.13,"StringencyLegacyIndex":70.24,"StringencyLegacyIndexForDisplay":70.24,"country":"US","date":1584576000000},{"C1_Flag":0.0,"C1_Notes":null,"C1_School_closing":3.0,"C2_Flag":0.0,"C2_Notes":null,"C2_Workplace_closing":3.0,"C3_Cancel_public_events":2.0,"C3_Flag":0.0,"C3_Notes":null,"C4_Flag":0.0,"C4_Notes":null,"C4_Restrictions_on_gatherings":2.0,"C5_Close_public_transport":1.0,"C5_Flag":0.0,"C5_Notes":null,"C6_Flag":0.0,"C6_Notes":null,"C6_Stay_at_home_requirements":2.0,"C7_Flag":0.0,"C7_Notes":null,"C7_Restrictions_on_internal_movement":2.0,"C8_International_travel_controls":3.0,"C8_Notes":null,"ContainmentHealthIndex":68.56,"ContainmentHealthIndexForDisplay":68.56,"E1_Flag":null,"E1_Income_support":0.0,"E1_Notes":null,"E2_Debt_or_contract_relief":0.0,"E2_Notes":null,"E3_Fiscal_measures":0.0,"E3_Notes":null,"E4_International_support":0.0,"E4_Notes":null,"EconomicSupportIndex":0.0,"EconomicSupportIndexForDisplay":0.0,"GovernmentResponseIndex":58.01,"GovernmentResponseIndexForDisplay":58.01,"H1_Flag":1.0,"H1_Notes":null,"H1_Public_information_campaigns":2.0,"H2_Notes":null,"H2_Testing_policy":3.0,"H3_Contact_tracing":1.0,"H3_Notes":null,"H4_Emergency_investment_in_healthcare":0.0,"H4_Notes":null,"H5_Investment_in_vaccines":0.0,"H5_Notes":null,"M1_Notes":null,"M1_Wildcard":null,"StringencyIndex":67.13,"StringencyIndexForDisplay":67.13,"StringencyLegacyIndex":70.24,"StringencyLegacyIndexForDisplay":70.24,"country":"US","date":1584662400000},{"C1_Flag":0.0,"C1_Notes":null,"C1_School_closing":3.0,"C2_Flag":0.0,"C2_Notes":null,"C2_Workplace_closing":3.0,"C3_Cancel_public_events":2.0,"C3_Flag":0.0,"C3_Notes":null,"C4_Flag":0.0,"C4_Notes":"State by state differences shown in archived link: https:\/\/archive.vn\/6NqU4  Illinois March 21 at 5 p.m., which bans gatherings of more than 10 people.

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.      The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.      The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.      New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.      Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.      Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.   https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101","C7_Restrictions_on_internal_movement":2.0,"C8_International_travel_controls":3.0,"C8_Notes":null,"ContainmentHealthIndex":73.11,"ContainmentHealthIndexForDisplay":73.11,"E1_Flag":0.0,"E1_Income_support":2.0,"E1_Notes":"Unemployment insurance in the U.S. is state-specific, but overseen by the U.S. Dept. of Labor.

Extraordinary extension: leases that expire during the next two months after the entry into force of this rule are extended to six months.  Moratorium on payment: when the owner of the housing, physical or legal person, has an investment fund, the tenant may request a moratorium on payment of rent as long as the state of emergency is in effect. On the other hand, tenants may also apply for specific public aid.\"   ARCHIVED:
